Experiment turning historical records into data.

Treating text sources as data can enable exploration and research that would be impossible possible with manual tools. But transforming text to data can be complicated and require a lot of manual work. In this experiment we wanted to try if it was possible to create a process that could engage people in working on a text while at the same time create data for further processing in a feedback loop. How much work will it take? Are there steps that require skills that exclude participation?

The idea is to apply a kind of Fourier transform to chronologic historic text and parse people and places form the material.

## Workflow
We used the first year of Inrikes tidningar from 1645 as a sample. The text was digitized and transcribed by the National Library of Sweden in 1998 and made available as open data.
